"""
Coding guide line in Python
"""

1> Use range() instead of xrange =>after python 3.0 
   range() will produce elements one at time while iterating. same as xrange() in python < 3.0 version 
2> Try to use for else clause when ever it's possible
3> Use iter() with arguments like start and step

4> for i in range(0-10):
      print(i)
5> for reverse indexing : use reverse() first and then loop over it
   for i in reverse(nums)

6> looping over two collections: 
   zip() vs izip():
    
    zip() ==> Will uses the temport tuple to combine two collections, so it consumes more memory.
    izip() ==>
