1> Difference between List and Tuple 
   List: 
        1> It's mutable, Means values can be modified.
           example: 
                 mylist = [1, 2, 'x', 'abc', 5.0]
                 mylist[0] = 11 # 1 is replaed with 11
        2> It can containes different type of data and It can be mutable and imutable as well.
        
        3> Better for inseration and deletion operations.
        4> consumes more memory and procesing type beacuse dynamic nature of mutablity.
   
   Tupel:
         1> It's immutable : Means values can't be modified.
         exmaple:
              mytuple = (1, "a", "Hello", 2.0)
              mytuple[0] = 11 # error
         2> Simillor to list, can contains multiple data types and both mutabe and imutable object is allowed.
         3> The tuple is faster than the list because of static in nature and also consumes less mempory compared to list.
