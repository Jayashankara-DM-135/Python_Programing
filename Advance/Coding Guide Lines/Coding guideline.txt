1> Use range() instead of xrange =>after python 3.0 
   range() will produce elements one at time while iterating. same as xrange() in python < 3.0 version 
   
2> Try to use for else clause when ever it's possible

3> Use iter() with arguments like start and step

4> for i in range(0-10):
      print(i)
      
5> for reverse indexing : use reverse() first and then loop over it
   for i in reverse(nums)

6> looping over two collections: 
   zip() vs izip(): 
   izip was there in python 2.X , But in python 3 izip is renamed to zip.
   
   In Python2.x:
   zip(): It will produce all the output in one go. Hence it comsumes more memory and prcessing time as well.
   izip() : It's like Itertor, more specifically like generator, It produces output when we called it.
