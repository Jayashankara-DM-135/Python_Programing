1> In python string is immutable, so while reversing string or any string manipulation, Convert string into list.
  res = list(str)
  # Convert list into string.
  "".join(res)
  
2> Binary search : We compare Key with mid to make which side to move
   But, In modified Binary search tree we make decison by two setp:
    A> check left part is sorted or right port sorted by comparing start value with mid 
    B> Uses sorted part to check if mid value lies between that range:
          a> if yes, continue with that direction else
          b> chose other direction.
          

3> mid calculation:
    low + (high-low)//2
    Note: '//' floor division, div is highest prioroty than 
    
4> Sorted matrix extracting mid value    
    mid_ele = matrix[mid//col][mid%col]
