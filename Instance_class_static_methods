Diff b/w instance method , class method and static methods:

Instance method: 
> Used to access instance varibale , It also possible to access class varible.
> Can be called uisng object and class, Better to call using object as name suggets it's instance method.
> if we use class name to call instance method, then object of the class need to passed as a first paarmeter.
> First parameter to instamce method is 'self'.


Class Methods:
> Class methods are usually used to access class variables. It's not possible to access the instance varible.
> Can be called using both class and Object, Better to call using Class name since these method deleas with only class varible.
> Decalred using "@classmethod" keyword 
> Class method uses "cls" as a first parameter.

Static method:
> When method is not accessing any of class varible or instance varible then we should declare them as staic method.
> It does not take self or cls as a parameter.
> It can be called using Class name or Object name, Better to call using Class name.
> Declared using "@staticmethod"
